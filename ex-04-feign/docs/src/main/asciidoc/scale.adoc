= Scaling

[%step]
* We need to scale our Microservices
* Several Number API's
* All registered in Consul
* Deployed on several PIs
* Which instance to choose from?

== Architecture

== Client-Side Load Balancing

[%step]
* Several instances of same service registered
* The client gets all the registered instances
* Then choose from among these instances
* Following certain criterias
* Capacity, round-robin, cloud-provider availability-zone awareness, multi-tenancy

== Several to choose from

[%step]
* Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
* Apache Httpd
* Nginx
* Netflix Ribbon

== What is Ribbon?

[%step]
* Netflix implementation of Client-Side Load Balancing
* Fault tolerant
* Multiple protocols (HTTP, TCP, UDP) support
* Synchronous, asynchronous and reactive model
* Caching and batching
* Integrates with Feign using `Feing Ribbon`
