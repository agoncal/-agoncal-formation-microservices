= Circuit Breaker

[%step]
* We have two Microservices
* Book API calls Number API
* But Number API can fail
* How does Book API handle this failure?

== Architecture

== Circuit Breaker

[%step]
* Services sometimes collaborate when handling requests
* When invoked synchronously, there is always the possibility of being unavailable
* (or high latency)
* The failure of one service can potentially cascade to others
* Client should invoke a remote service via a proxy
* If consecutive failures, the circuit breaks

== Several to choose from

[%step]
* Build your own (CDI)
* JRugged
* MicroProfile Fault-Tolerance
* Netflix Hystrix

== What is Hystrix?

[%step]
* Netflix implementation of Circuit Breaker
* Construct a `HystrixCommand` represents the request you are making
* Execute the `HystrixCommand`
* Is the Circuit Open?
** Yes: Hystrix will not execute the command and fallsback
** No: proceeds
* Integrates with Feign using `Feign Hystrix`

== Book API Falling back
