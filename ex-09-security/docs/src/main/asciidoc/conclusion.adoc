= Conclusion

== Lessons learnt

[%step]
* Micro Services are hard
* Micro Services are bloody hard
* Need to integrate with a lot of infrastucture
* Run in different environments (local, docker, pi)
* The more technologies the harder
* The more languages the harder
* The more versions the harder

== And...

[%step]
* We didn't have databases
* We didn't have a complex business logic
* We didn't have a complex network
* We didn't duplicate and load balance the registry
* We didn't use asynchronous events
* We didn't do integration testing
* We didn't do tracing (Zipkin)
* We didn't do rate limit on our APIs

== Advantages

[%step]
* Deliver new features quicker
* Smaller, more agile teams
* Deliver business features as services
* Scale services independently
* Address unpredictable loads
* Cloud

== But remember

[%step]
* Use this type of architecture
* If you need it
* Because it brings you advantages
* Not because the others are doing it
